Welcome to my page. I am a data scientist working in causal inference and health tech. I help evaluate the effectiveness of health system programs, this work is at the core of our evidence-based policy efforts. The goal is to measure program performance to inform their development and drive improvements. 

The theme of this blog is to explore how to operationalize widely used empirical tools from economics and machine learning to implement and support health policy initiatives.

I am currently working on three areas of focus:
- Implementing impact evaluations that establish causal links to isolate and measure the effects that can be attributed to an intervention.
- Developing planned experimentation through the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) approach to sequentially develop knowledge, rigorously testing service improvements and empirically measuring their impact to achieve positive, evidence-based outcomes.
- Developing communication strategies that translate project findings into actionable insights for policy development, stakeholder engagement, and coalition-building.
