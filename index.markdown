Welcome to my page. I am a data scientist working in healthcare using causal inference and machine learning to develop health tech solutions. I help evaluate the effectiveness of health system programs, this work is at the core of our evidence-based policy efforts. 

My primary areas of focus are:
- Implementing impact evaluations to find causal links that isolate and measure effects that can be attributed to an intervention. The goal is to inform program development and drive improvements. 
- Designing planned experimentations of ongoing interventions to sequentially develop knowledge, test outcomes, and measure their impact to achieve positive and evidence-based improvements.
- Developing communication strategies that translate study findings into actionable insights for policy development, stakeholder engagement, and coalition-building.  

The theme of this blog is to exploring and operationalizing up-to-date empirical tools from economics and machine learning to implement and support health policy initiatives.
