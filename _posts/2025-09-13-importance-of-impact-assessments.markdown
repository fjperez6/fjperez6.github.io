This is the first in a series of posts dedicated to impact assessments (IA). We will examine the importance of robust evaluation methods, detail the steps involved, and identify tools that help with the implementation. We will also review and interpret results to help maximize outcomes.

IAs are used in evaluating health system programs through causal inference methods that measure a program's true impact on health outcomes. The focus is on attribution by statistically "controlling for" other variables that can influence the result in order to isolate a program's effect. This part is key to reliable evidence-based policy making that informs program improvements and helps drive better health outcomes. Additionally, the results of an IA can be used in cost-effectiveness analysis.

# Load the necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Create some sample data
set.seed(42)
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:50,
  y = 1:50 + rnorm(50, mean = 0, sd = 10)
)

# Fit a linear model
model <- lm(y ~ x, data = df)

# Print a summary of the model
summary(model)
